def post(self,request):
        auth_token = request.headders.get('Authorization')
        payload = request.data
------->

POST /example-endpoint/
Authorization: Bearer abc123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
Then:

auth_token would be "Bearer abc123"

payload would be {'name': 'John', 'email': 'john@example.com'}
